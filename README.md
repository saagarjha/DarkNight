# DarkNight [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/saagarjha/DarkNight.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/saagarjha/DarkNight)

DarkNight was a launch agent that matched Night Shift and the system appearance: however, with the release of macOS Catalina, this feature has now been Sherlocked. As such, DarkNight now just runs a script of your choosing (by default, `/usr/local/bin/dark-night`, but customizable via `defaults write com.saagarjha.DarkNight command /path/to/your/script`) whenever the system appearance changes so you can complete the transition. The legacy version of DarkNight, for macOS Mojave and below, is available at the [legacy branch](https://github.com/saagarjha/DarkNight/tree/legacy).
