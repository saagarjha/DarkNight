# DarkNight

DarkNight is a launch agent that matches Night Shift and the system appearance: when Night Shift turns on, your computer will turn dark, and vice versa. During the transition, DarkNight will also call a script at `/usr/local/bin/night-shift` so that you can perform additional work to complete the transition.
